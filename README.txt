# Assessment


Code to refactor
=================
1) app/Http/Controllers/BookingController.php

* The provided index() had a nested condition. I channged with ternary operation.

* In the distanceFeed() I combined update queries for Distance and Job model for improve efficiency.

* In some methods like store(),update(),acceptJob() etc.. I directly passed the request data for improve request handling.

* Renamed variables for more clarity and readability.

* I removed unused variables ($adminSenderEmail, $session, $affectedRows, etc.) 

2) app/Repository/BookingRepository.php

* Moved the logger initialization to a separate method for better readability and maintainability.

* getUsersJobs() - Replaced array() with [] ,if ($jobs) to if (!empty($jobs)),== with === for strict comparison.

* store() -  camelCase variable naming convention for $immediateTime and $consumerType.
* Removed duplicate code for field validation.
* Simplified setting default values for customer_phone_type and customer_physical_type.
* Removed unnecessary conversion of job_for values.
* Added comments for better code understanding.
* Improved readability and code structure for better maintainability.

* storeJobEmail() -  camelCase variable naming convention for $userType and $jobId.
* Used the null coalescing operator (??) for setting default values for $job->reference.
* Simplified the logic for determining email recipient and name.
* Simplified the logic for determining job address, instructions, and town.
* Improved variable naming and code readability.

* jobToData() -Used camelCase variable naming convention for $data.
* Used the syntax [] instead of array() for creating arrays.
* Simplified the extraction of the due date and time using explode.
* Used switch statement for determining job_for values based on certified status.

* jobEnd()- Used camelCase variable naming convention for $postData.
* Utilized PHP's date interval format %h:%i:%s to get the session time interval.
* Simplified the logic for determining the email recipient for the customer.
* Combined the logic for sending emails to the customer and the translator.

* Merged the ignoreExpiring and ignoreExpired methods into a single updateJobIgnoreStatus method, as they have similar functionality.
* Introduced a private method updateThrottleIgnoreStatus to handle ignoring throttle records.
* Reused the common functionality to update the ignore status of jobs and throttles, reducing code duplication.
* Added error handling to return an error message if the job or throttle is not found.
* Improved variable naming for better readability ($jobId, $userId, etc.).
* Added error handling in case the job is not found.
